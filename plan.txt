Current Focus, create a form the will let the user input where they want to have the weather:
* in index.js, create a dropdown named 'How would you like to find the weather?' with the options:
['city name', 'zip code and country', 'longitude and latitude' ]
and then make it have the body as the parent. ** using npm package "@jackalot/createdropdown.js": "^1.0.0"
- after the dropdown gets clicked, make a promise that there will be a new field and a label based off
the selected item in the dropdown.
- if 'zip code and country' is selected, two fields, one labeled country, and one labeled zip code will be
selected due to zip code defaulting to the USA.
psuedo code:
const body = document.querySelector(body);
createDropdown(body, 'How would you like to find the weather?', ['city name', 'zip code and country', 'longitude and latitude' ]);
