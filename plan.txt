Current Focus, write functions that hit our apis:
* in index.html, make a button with the class and text "fetch weather"
( we'll use this for testing later )
- still in index.html, make an empty p tag that will be used for displaying the weather.
* in index.js, make an async function called fetchWeather(){
    - make a reference to the weather 'p' tag thats empty
    - create a response variable that equals an await fetch and it will have the mode cors. (it will be
     fetching:
     'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&APPID=ea13d76af44f95e6e901a4a69585bb22')
    - a new variable will be created which will be an await call for response to be parsed with the json
    method and the new variable would be called weatherData
    - we will then log the weatherData
}
psuedo script (index.js):
async function fetchGiffy() {
  const weatherParagraph = document.querySelector('.weather');
  const response = await fetch('http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&APPID=ea13d76af44f95e6e901a4a69585bb22', { mode: 'cors' });
  const weatherData = await response.json();
  console.log(weatherData);
}
