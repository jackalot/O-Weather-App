Current Focus, write functions that hit our apis:
* in index.html, make a button with the class and text "fetch giffy"
* in index.js, make an async function called fetchGiffy()
{
    - it will have a reference to the empty giffy image element via document.querySelector()
    - it will have a variable called response that equals an await
    fetch request to our api to giffy and it will be mode cors (which will be to:
     "https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/translate?api_key=1wCBlxlhZg8hx21BVDkIfPtthGp61X1f&s=cats")
    - we will store the response after parsing through the json() method via a 'querydata' variable;
    - then the img.src will equal querydata.data.images.original.url;

}
* under that button 
* in index.html, make a button with the class and text "fetch weather"
( we'll use this for testing later )
- still in index.html, make an empty p tag that will be used for displaying the weather.
